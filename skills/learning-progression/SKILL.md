# Learning Progression Skill

Master the art of understanding prerequisites, mapping skill dependencies, and designing optimal learning sequences to accelerate your path to mastery.

## Quick Start

```

## Prerequisite Validation

**Before Starting a New Skill, Ask**:

1. **Do I understand the prerequisites?**
   - Can I explain core concepts?
   - Could I build something simple from scratch?

2. **Have I built projects with prerequisites?**
   - Applied knowledge practically?
   - Solved real problems?

3. **Am I confident in fundamentals?**
   - No gaps in understanding?
   - Ready to apply new concepts?

**Signs You're Ready to Progress**:
✅ Can explain concepts to others
✅ Solved 3-5 practice problems independently
✅ Built at least one project
✅ Feel confident explaining "why" not just "how"
✅ Can troubleshoot issues without tutorials

## Adaptive Pacing

### Full-Time Learning (40+ hours/week)
- Foundations: 2-3 weeks
- Intermediate: 4-6 weeks
- Advanced: 8-12 weeks
- **Total to job-ready**: 4-6 months

### Part-Time Learning (15-20 hours/week)
- Foundations: 4-6 weeks
- Intermediate: 8-12 weeks
- Advanced: 12-16 weeks
- **Total to job-ready**: 9-12 months

### Very Part-Time (<10 hours/week)
- Foundations: 8-12 weeks
- Intermediate: 12-20 weeks
- Advanced: 20-32 weeks
- **Total to job-ready**: 12-24 months

## Learning Sequence Optimization

### Parallel vs Sequential

**Sequential Learning** (Recommended for beginners):
```
Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced
(Master each before moving on)
Benefits: Deeper understanding, fewer gaps
Duration: Longer but more effective
```

**Parallel Learning** (Advanced learners):
```
Foundation Topic A ─→ Intermediate A
           ↓
Foundation Topic B ─→ Intermediate B
```

**Hybrid Approach** (Most effective):
```
Core skill (sequential) + Complementary skill (parallel)

Example:
JavaScript (core) → React → TypeScript
         ↓
    Git (parallel, can learn alongside)
```

## Skill Verification

**Self-Check Before Advancing**:

```
LEVEL 1 - AWARE (20%):
□ I can recognize the term
□ I know what it's used for
□ I understand basic concepts
□ NOT YET: Ready to use independently

LEVEL 2 - NOVICE (40%):
□ I can follow tutorials
□ I can implement with documentation
□ I understand most concepts
□ NEXT: Build simple projects independently

LEVEL 3 - COMPETENT (65%):
□ I can solve problems independently
□ I understand design decisions
□ I can optimize basic solutions
□ NEXT: Learn advanced patterns and optimization

LEVEL 4 - EXPERT (85%):
□ I can mentor others
□ I understand trade-offs deeply
□ I can optimize complex systems
□ NEXT: Contribute to open-source, teach
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Skipping fundamentals** for fancy frameworks
✅ Master basics before advanced topics

❌ **Learning in isolation** without projects
✅ Apply knowledge immediately to projects

❌ **Parallel learning** of strict dependencies
✅ Sequence strict dependencies strictly

❌ **Passive watching** without practice
✅ Code along actively, build projects

❌ **Moving too fast** despite gaps
✅ Validate understanding before advancing
