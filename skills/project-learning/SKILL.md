## Project Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Planning (1-2 hours)

```
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS
□ Read project description
□ List all features required
□ Identify data structures
□ Sketch UI/UX (if frontend)
□ Define API endpoints (if backend)

STEP 2: BREAK INTO TASKS

□ Estimate hours per task
□ Identify blockers
□ Plan implementation order
□ Set realistic timeline

STEP 3: SETUP
□ Create project scaffold
□ Setup version control
□ Configure build tools
□ Write README skeleton
□ Commit initial setup
```

### Phase 2: Development (Main Project Time)

```
